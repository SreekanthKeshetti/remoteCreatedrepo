# remoteCreatedrepo

Here I created a repo in remote and use in the local machine.
now i will clone this repo to the local machine and make changes and will again push back to the git-hub and these are the following steps:
step1: the step one is done , it cloning the git repo to local the command used is git clone <--repo link-->
step2: now as i made some changes to the cloned project will have to stage abd commit this. This can be done by commands add and commit.
step3: add and commit
step4: once all this is done will push the code from local to the remote.
